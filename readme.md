#Cloudflare API V4 PHP wrapper

A work in progress library for the new Cloudflare API. The documentation for the new API  can be found at http://developers.cloudflare.com/next/.


I have integrated most of the methods available but many features from the current API have not been implemented yet. For now I suggest you use the API wrapper written by [vexxhost](https://github.com/vexxhost) which can befound at https://github.com/vexxhost/CloudFlare-API.


##Installation
Installation should be done via composer, details of how to install composer can be found at https://getcomposer.org/


Add `"quibax/cloudflare": "dev-master"` to your `composer.json` file

Run `composer update` to install the latest version.

##Usage

In situations where you want to make multiple calls to the API across different services it's easier to create a connection to the api first and then pass that around the other services e.g.

```php
    use JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare;
    use JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare\Zone\Dns;

    // Create a connection to the Cloudflare API which you can
    // then pass into other services, e.g. DNS, later on
    $client = new JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare\Api('email@example.com', 'API_KEY');

    // Create a new DNS record
    $dns = new JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare\Dns($client);
    $dns->create('12345678901234567890', 'TXT', '127.0.0.1', 120);
```

If you are just performing a single action then you can connect to the API directly when you instantiate the class e.g.
```php
    use JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare;

    // Create a connection to the Cloudflare API which you can
    // then pass into other services, e.g. DNS, later on
    $dns = new JamesRyanBell\Cloudflare\Zone\Dns('email@example.com', 'API_KEY');
    $dns->create('12345678901234567890', 'TXT', '127.0.0.1', 120);
```
